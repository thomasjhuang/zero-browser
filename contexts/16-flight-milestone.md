# 16 Flight demonstration milestone

Priority P0. Owner Codex milestone chat. First stage: model-free preparation.

## Why

The user selected a dependable flight-search demonstration. Runtime safety precedes local inference.
The reported computer freeze has no established cause.

## Do

- Preserve task 15 safeguards and active ownership of tasks 12 and 13.
- Add a separate milestone runner, durable event records, fixed tasks, and independent outcome tests.
- Primary: San Francisco to Boston, November 16, 2026. Variations: November 17 and Seattle on November 16.
- Use one adult, economy, and one-way travel for every flight task. Stop with matching options visible.
- Permit navigation, scrolling, search fields, autocomplete, filters, and search submission.
- Stop for login, CAPTCHA, flight selection, booking, payment, messages, and account changes.
- Include a local multi-step task, crowded controls, and changed control order.
- Preserve failed and interrupted records. Measure total time, decision time, calls, and memory.
- Remove repeated prompt content before cache work. Coordinate changes to task 13 files.

## Verify

- Run model-free safety and outcome tests before inference.
- Prepare one short local run. Wait for user readiness before starting it.
- Obtain user observations about responsiveness and cancellation before longer runs.
- Test every requested requirement independently. DONE alone never establishes success.
- Seek three consecutive primary successes, then run both variations. Keep comparison conditions fixed.
- Follow the required lint, tests, commit, and push procedure. Keep evidence in results/.

## Do not

Do not load Qwen during preparation. Do not run concurrent benchmarks or hosted models.
Do not add site-specific decision rules, hardcoded field answers, or a separate Markdown report.

## Result

Model-free preparation passed. Evidence: [preparation](../results/milestone-preparation.json).
The user then reported a visible page, a responsive computer, and clean browser closure.

The runner now removes unused startup tabs and shows the task page. It fixes the local starting address.
The local prompt omits duplicate targets and separates current dropdown values from available changes.
Failed prompt experiments were removed. No cache optimization was added.

[Run evidence](../results/milestone-local-runs.json) preserves the pilots and failed local experiments.
The normal task skipped the origin. The reversed task submitted two adults instead of one.
DONE did not establish success. The crowded run reached its external deadline with an unfinished model call.
Earlier runs used random local ports, so their comparisons are exploratory.

The last pilot cancelled during inference. The worker stopped 36 milliseconds after the cancellation request.
The user still needs to report responsiveness and browser closure for that cancellation test.
The runner retains partial records under ignored `artifacts/milestone/`. `--report` reads them without inference.

The milestone remains open. No live flight task passed, and the flight variations remain untested.
Next: resolve omitted requirements and premature completion, then obtain repeated local and primary successes.
The live flight verifier remains untested. The freeze cause remains unknown.

Use `--pilot --ready` only after user readiness. The pilot permits two decisions and cancels after three seconds.
The worker deadline is twenty seconds. Browser startup has a separate twenty-second deadline.
Cleanup adds time after cancellation. Do not start longer runs before the pending user observations.
